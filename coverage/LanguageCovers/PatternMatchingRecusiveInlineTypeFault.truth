//
// A fault is generated when a pattern attempts to match one or more 
// types that are elements of a recursive structure. Even if this were proven
// to not result in a plethora of corner cases (which hasn't been fully
// explored at the time of this writing), the amount of complexity that
// this would introduce into the compiler would be similar to the
// complexity of building an entire Parsing Expression Grammar
// (such as PegJS) or Parsing DSL (such as Chevrotain).
