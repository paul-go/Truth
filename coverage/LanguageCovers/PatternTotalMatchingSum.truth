// 
// This example demonstrates a total pattern matching the
// "sum" of another type. A type's "sum" refers to the textual
// content present on the left side of the last fragment of a
// type. A type cannot have multiple sums, but the same sum
// may be shared between different types.

Summation
/\w{3},w{3}/ : Summation

Value1, Value2 : aaa,bbb
Value1, Value2 : ccc,ddd

Value1 ~ Summation
Value2 ~ Summation

// Value1 and Value2 would have the value cc,ddd
// Not aaa,bbb
// 
// This can't be expressed as a check in this file due
// to a limitation of the test generator.
