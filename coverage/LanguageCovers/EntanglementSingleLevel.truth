//
// Demonstration of Entanglement
// Truth's A : B operator doesn't directly translate to "A is a B". More specifically,
// it means "A is a subtype of how B is typed in this context". Therefore, it is possible
// to inherit from a type, and apply more specificity to the inherited types, causing
// potentially many types across entire inherited structure to have more specific
// typing applied.
