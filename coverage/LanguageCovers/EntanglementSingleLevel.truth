// Demonstration of Entanglement
// Truth's A : B operator doesn't directly translate to "A is a B". More specifically,
// it means "A is a sub of how B is defined in this context". Therefore, it is possible
// to derive from a fact, and apply more specificity to the inherited facts, causing
// potentially many facts across entire inherited structure to have more specific
// typing applied.
