//
// This example demonstrates refreshing a fresh type,
// aka a "Refresh type". Refresh types are used to force
// a fresh type, in the case when there is undesirable
// inference coming through the containment hierarchy.
// 
// This example also covers a possibly bizarre case,
// where a type without the refresh syntax is actually 
// a refresh type, due to an equivalently-named type
// using the refresh syntax within the same locality.
//
// Use of the refresh syntax generates a fault in the
// case when a base class imposes a contract on the
// type that is using the syntax. This is because these
// types cannot be refreshed, as it would make the
// type incompatible with it's base.
